# What is Filecoin & IPFS?

[IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) is a peer-to-peer network and protocol designed to make the web faster, safer, and more open. IPFS upgrades the web to work peer-to-peer, addressing data by what it is instead of where it‚Äôs located on the network or who is hosting it.

[Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) is the world‚Äôs largest decentralized network offering more than 16+ Exbibytes of storage. It allows users to store, request, and transfer data via a verifiable marketplace. Filecoin is completely open-source, enabling people from all over the world to participate.
